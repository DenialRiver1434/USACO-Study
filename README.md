# USACO-Study

This is a public collection of implementations to all the competition programming problems I have solved!

### Correctness

All of the code stored here are capable of earning AC on all testcases, though a very few might have small bugs. 

I apologize if some of the code is stored in the wrong folder or under the wrong name, which is an issue that occasionally occurs.

### Using this Repository

You may not pass of the code in this repository as your own (plagarize), but you may use it for educational purposes. However, unlike
code I upload to usaco.guide or write in lecture notes, most of these are NOT written to be understandable.
